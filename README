Running the program using CMD:

- Compile both files using "javac PacketReceiver.java" and "javac PacketSender.java" (If not already compiled, .class files should be there)
- Run receiver first using "java PacketReceiver" and then run sender by "java PacketSender"
- The sender will prompt for a server IP (machine IP) and then prompt for a payload. 



Running using Eclipse:

- Run the receiver first then run the sender, you will be prompted for ip and data.
